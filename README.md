The given code snippet creates a `MetricPayload` object to send metrics data to a monitoring service, presumably Datadog (DD API). Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

### 1. Creating the `MetricPayload` object
```java
MetricPayload body = new MetricPayload()
```
- This line initializes a new `MetricPayload` object named `body`. This object will hold the data for the metric you want to send.

### 2. Setting the `series` field
```java
.series(
    Collections.singletonList(
        new MetricSeries()
```
- The `series` method is called on the `MetricPayload` object to set a list of `MetricSeries` objects. Here, `Collections.singletonList` creates a list with a single `MetricSeries` object.

### 3. Configuring the `MetricSeries` object
```java
.metric("sada.SYS.hits")
```
- The `metric` method sets the name of the metric, in this case, "sada.SYS.hits".

```java
.type(MetricIntakeType.COUNT)
```
- The `type` method sets the type of the metric. `MetricIntakeType.COUNT` indicates that the metric is a count type, meaning it counts the number of occurrences of an event.

### 4. Setting the metric points
```java
.points(
    Collections.singletonList(
        new MetricPoint()
            .timestamp(OffsetDateTime.now().toInstant().getEpochSecond())
            .value(1.00)))
```
- The `points` method sets a list of `MetricPoint` objects, each representing a data point for the metric.
- `Collections.singletonList` creates a list with a single `MetricPoint` object.
- The `timestamp` method sets the time at which the data point was recorded. `OffsetDateTime.now().toInstant().getEpochSecond()` gets the current time in seconds since the epoch (Unix time).
- The `value` method sets the value of the metric at the given timestamp, in this case, `1.00`.

### 5. Setting the resources
```java
.resources(
    Collections.singletonList(
        new MetricResource().name("dummyhost").type("host")))));
```
- The `resources` method sets a list of `MetricResource` objects, each representing a resource associated with the metric.
- `Collections.singletonList` creates a list with a single `MetricResource` object.
- The `name` method sets the name of the resource, in this case, "dummyhost".
- The `type` method sets the type of the resource, in this case, "host".

### Summary
The code constructs a `MetricPayload` object with the following structure:
- A metric named "sada.SYS.hits" of type count.
- One data point with the current timestamp and a value of 1.00.
- A resource named "dummyhost" of type "host".

This payload is ready to be sent to the Datadog API to record the specified metric.
